# CS146S: The Modern Software Developer

## Stanford University • Fall 2025

These are my own notes and solutions to the Stanford CS146S course, which is freely available at [themodernsoftware.dev](https://themodernsoftware.dev/).

As of writing there are no video recordings of the lectures that are publicly available, however the course does provide the following for its ten weeks:
- Topics covered
- Lecture slides and notes
- An extensive reading list
- A weekly assignment

Therefore there is plenty of material available for anyone to follow along. The assignments are all available at [github.com/mihail911/modern-software-dev-assignments](https://github.com/mihail911/modern-software-dev-assignments) and this is my fork of that repo.
